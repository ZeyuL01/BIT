# BayesIMTR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **BayesIMTR** is to identify the potential master
transcriptional regulators with the input derived from chromatin
accessibility profiling methods(e.g. ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, MNase-seq),
the input can be either a file that stores the information of “peaks”
generated by common peak-calling algorithms (e.g. MACS2, Homer) or
user-defined regions, such as peaks from a differential accessibility
analysis(e.g. DiffBind).

## Installation

You can install the development version of BayesIMTR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ZeyuL01/BayesIMTR) with:

    #> Skipping install of 'BayesIMTR' from a github remote, the SHA1 (4d6fe904) has not changed since last install.
    #>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(BayesIMTR)
#> Loading required package: RcppArmadillo
#> Loading required package: RcppDist
#> Loading required package: RcppProgress
library(kableExtra)

##package has three demo knock-out experiment derived datasets c("CTCF","KDM1A","ZBTB7A")
##can take ~10 mins to finish for 1000 rounds.
CTCF_Demo_mat <- Demo(1000,"CTCF")
#> [1] "Time used: 3.55 mins for 1000 rounds."
```

Let’s see the results of CTCF demo data.

``` r
##Show_Results can summarize the results from Gibbs sampler.
##must specify the burnin
CTCF_Results <- Show_Results(CTCF_Demo_mat,burnin=500)
CTCF_Theta_ij_db <- CTCF_Results[["Theta_ij"]]
CTCF_Theta_i_db <- CTCF_Results[["Theta_i"]]

head(CTCF_Theta_ij_db,10)
#> NULL
```

As we can see, CTCF is ranked into the top 10 TF in the final result.

We may also check the higher level parameters that integrate information
from individual ChIP-seq tracks to give one unique rank to each TF.

``` r
head(CTCF_Theta_i_db,10)
#> NULL
```

This time CTCF is ranked even higher to the top 1 position over all 1472
TFs.
