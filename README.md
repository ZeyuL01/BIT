The goal of **BIT** is to identify the transcriptional regulators that govern user-defined epigenomic regions (e.g. ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, MNase-seq), the input can be either a file that stores the information of “peaks” generated by common peak-calling algorithms (e.g. MACS2) or any specific user-defined regions, such as peaks from a differential accessibility analysis (e.g. DiffBind).

## Read the Docs documentation
We have an instruction manual on readthedocs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BIT from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ZeyuL01/BIT) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("ZeyuL01/BIT")
#library(BIT)
#> ℹ Loading BIT
```

If you meet a compilation problem,

Or submit your questions through issues, we are happy to answer them.

## Load ChIP-seq data

Pre-compiled ChIP-seq database can be accessed through:
<[https://smu.box.com/s/mhpelp5zro7538pbfkfj65xf61842huo](https://smu.box.com/s/dswrvsz4chh7ygkjpwdq3lex2gvrz2gi)>

``` r
#Please download the chip-seq file and unzip it to a local directory.
#For example: /.../Desktop/data/ChIP-seq/macs2_peaks_inds_1000/

#The function below needs to run once to set up.

chip_path = "/.../Desktop/data/ChIP-seq/macs2_peaks_inds_1000/"
load_chip_data(chip_path, bin_width = 1000)

#> [1] "ChIP-seq data successfully loaded, please run BIT with input to check!"
#> NULL
```

## Quick start to use BIT.

It is very simple to run **BIT** as long as you have the input file with the format as one of 
bed/narrowPeak/broadPeak/bigNarrowPeak/csv.

``` r
#As an example, the user-input peak set file path is "file_path/CTCF.bed"
input_path = "file_path/CTCF.bed"
output_path = "output_path/"
input_test<-BIT(input_path, output_path)
#> [1] "Load and map peaks to bins..."
#> [1] "Done."
#> [1] "Compare the input regions with the pre-compiled reference ChIP-seq data, bin width used: 1000 bps"
#> ==================================================[1] "Done."
#> [1] "Start BIT Gibbs sampler, iterations: 5000"
#> [1] "Done."
