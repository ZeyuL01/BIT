**BIT** - **B**ayesian Hierarchical Modeling for **I**dentification of **T**ranscriptional Regulators from Query Region Sets
===========================================================


.. image:: ./images/Figure_1.png

**BIT** (**B**ayesian Hierarchical Modeling for **I**dentification of **T**ranscriptional Regulators from Query Region Sets) is a novel bioinformatics tool designed to identify transcriptional regulators from a user-provided set of epigenomic regions. These regions are typically derived from genome-wide epigenomic profiling data that probe specific biological processes, such as ATAC-seq and DNase-seq. Using a pre-processed reference library containing over 10,000 human TR ChIP-seq datasets and over 5,000 mouse TR ChIP-seq datasets, **BIT** leverages a Bayesian hierarchical model to achieve higher accuracy and enhanced interpretability.
