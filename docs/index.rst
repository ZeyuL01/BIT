BIT - Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling for Identification of Transcriptional Regulators from Query Region Sets
===========================================================


.. image:: ./images/Figure_1.png

The goal of BIT is to identify the transcriptional regulators that govern user-provided epigenomic regions generated by epigenomic profiling techniques (e.g. ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, MNase-seq), the input can be either a file that stores the information of “peaks” such as from a differential accessibility analysis (e.g. DiffBind).
