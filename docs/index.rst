BIT (Bayesian Identification of Transcriptional Regulators)
================================

.. raw:: html

    <style> .red {color:red} </style>

.. role:: red

The goal of BIT is to identify the potential master transcriptional regulators with the input derived from chromatin accessibility profiling methods(e.g. ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, MNase-seq), the input can be either a file that stores the information of “peaks” generated by common peak-calling algorithms (e.g. MACS2, Homer) or user-defined regions, such as peaks from a differential accessibility analysis(e.g. DiffBind).

Examples
--------

All of the following are defined within the ``docs/index.rst`` file. Here is
some :red:`coloured` text which demonstrates how raw HTML commands can be
incorporated. The following are examples of ``rst`` "admonitions":

The remainder of this document shows three tables of contents for the main
``README`` (under "Introduction"), and the vignettes and R directories of
a package. These can be restructured any way you like by changing the main
``docs/index.rst`` file. The contents of this file -- and indeed the contents
of any `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org>`_ file -- can be viewed by
